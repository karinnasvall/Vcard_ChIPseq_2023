# <i>Vanessa cardui</i> hostplant availability ChIPseq
 
 Repository associated to the manuscript <b>"Resource availability affects activity profiles of regulatory elements in a long-distance butterfly migrant"</b>, NÃ¤svall et al. under review. The project describes the distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks detected with ChIPseq in adult female <i>Vanessa cardui</i> in  response to access to hostplant. Do acess to hostplant for oviposition induces a change in the histone modifications associated to regulatory element activity and which genes are in proximity of potential regulatory changes? 
 
 The repository contains brief notes on nfcore-pipeline and the scripts used to analyse differential peak enrichment.
